                                            SMART IRRIGATION SYSTEM USING WATER PUMP 
                       **************************************************************************** 
OBJECTIVE- We have designed a system which controls the Water pump based on Moisture detection. 
The pump automatically turns Off and, On the pump, based on the timer & Moisture detection. For this project we need a Moisture sensor and a pump apart from the Rpi Kit. 

Components & KIT- Raspberry pi 3 Model B, Grove pi, sensors, Universal Serial Bus(USB) & Water Pump 5V. 
KIT- GrovePi+ Cana Kit- Plug and Play kit of sensors that turns any object into an Internet-connected device. No soldering required. C & Python libraries are available for Linux, C# libraries available for Wimdows IOT. 

Development platform- The development platform that we have used is Raspberry pi, IBM Watson and Nodered. In IBM Watson we have used Dashboard to create our gauges. There are total of 8 gauges on IBM Watson which represent all real time data reading from sensors through python script and stores all real time data on IBM Watson cloud platform. For Node-Red we have displayed the real time data of moisture, temperature and humidity with the flows and display it on gauges.
